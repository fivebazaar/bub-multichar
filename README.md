# bub-multichar
 
A multicharacter system built for [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core). The code is primarily just from qbx_core own multicharacter, i have just added a UI using Mantine instead of using the [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) functionalities which [qb-core](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-core) own multicharacter does.
